  var para="Students come to college with a lot of expectations, hopes, and goals and often with some fears. Students have to face a series of challenges while in college. Whether it is academics, attendance, exams, parental pressures, lack of sleep, social pressures, language barrier, student-faculty interactions, or food, students are constantly under various pressures and changes throughout their time in college. It can often be up to the department to create a nurturing space for growth, accountability, learning, critical thinking and problem solving. A major aspect of a student’s experience in college are their social interactions and social relationships. This is something they are faced with on a daily basis. The social interactions you have in college determine your experience and the extent to which you are able to grow and become the kind of person you want to be on a professional and personal level. The social networks you form in college can stick with you throughout your life. It affects several aspects of a students’ life, some of which include their academic development, studying ability, placements and personal relationships. As a department, the School of Public Health (SPH) aims to create an environment necessary for them to explore their potential, grow academically and personally. We believe we provide student with a nurturing environment in terms mentorship, guidance and opportunities for growth. Our mentorship program aims to tackle, the often lack of, faculty and student interaction and engagement. Students are connected to a faculty member from the time they join the department to when they graduate. Throughout this time, they are able to seek help from their mentors for personal, academic and professional matters. This has helped students not only learn how to develop professional relationships, but to get the guidance they may need when necessary, without hesitation. This program has been effective in giving students a designated person they are able to go to when faced with a challenge. Social relationships and interactions during one’s college experience make up a very important aspect of a student’s life. This can often be challenging for many students and is important to address as they experience it, through mentorship program and giving students a space to be open and honest. What can SPH offer you? SRM, School of Public Health (SPH) aims to create public health leaders through interdisciplinary education and research. As part of SPH, the University Wellness Program (UWP) looks at the wellness of all the students on campus. Our aim is to look at various factors that affect student’s wellbeing and find ways to address them. Wellness plays a significant role in the lives of students on a daily basis. SRM, as a whole, has made it a priority to help students address the various challenges that may come with wellness, especially in terms your mental health. It is becoming more and more important to address these issues, especially in today’s climate of uncertainty and adjusting to the new norm of life, education, socialization, interactions and everything that comes with that. SPH is dedicated to not only provide students with a good academic foundation but also provides opportunities to grow as people.";
